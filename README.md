# basic-sigmoid-ML
Python deep learning neural network sigmoid based - come as a following part of bit.ly/1RnBCR5  

The initial tutorial is great for beginner.
It was covering from layer 2 to layer 3.

I have added an easy way to handle from layer 4 to any higher value using a simple variablef
+ graph output
+ extra note to go deeper in the visualisation of neural networkr

This should help understanding why we have to use transposition sometimes and why we use some particular size of weights matrix  ( syn 0 / syn1 ... )
